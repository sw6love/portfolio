    <p>I'm Jacintha. I have three years experience in building FX products for financial institution and large corporate customers. I come from an FX and interest rates sales and trading background. My current project is building streaming FX execution and algorithms for bank traders and other finacnial institution customers. I work to keep my dog in the syle that he is accustomed too. He doesn't like software development but he does like sausages.
